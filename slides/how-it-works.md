## How it works

#### **Goal**: Automatically obtain a *browser-trusted certificate*, without any human intervention

* Two steps to this process:

  1. Agent **proves** to the Certificate Authority (`CA`) that the web server controls a domain
  2. Agent can **request**, **renew**, and **revoke** certificates for that domain
